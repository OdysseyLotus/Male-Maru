	<description>Adds male Maru and a custom Maru name generator. Made with permission from VAMV.
	
I have to admit, when I saw the Maru race come out, I was really excited. I thought that it had a really solid aesthetic, I love the black-white-blue color scheme, and it looked like it had some neat mechanics. So I bumped this mod higher up on my to-do list so that I could add males to it and play with it as soon as I could. I hope that you guys enjoy this mod!

Alright, time for a little overview. I added male bodies, heads, and hair (these are edited versions of hairstyles from AFU男士发型_Men's hairstyles) and tweaked the apparel to fit the new bodies. For the hair, I lighten the color, resized it to fit the heads, and added the cute little spot/stripe things to the bangs. I hope you enjoy!

Additionally, I decided that I would spend more time than I am comfortable admitting to creating a custom namer for the Maru. Basically, I looked up which countries snow leopards live in and chose names based on those places. Thus, Maru will now spawn with Bengali, Chinese, Hindi, Kazakh, Mongolian, Nepali, Pakistani, Punjabi, or Russian names. Their first and last names will have matching nationalities for consistencies. I literally spent the last several days researching and writing 3,612 first names and 1,517 surnames. I put in an frankly unnecessary and laughable amount of effort into making the name generator, but I hope you enjoy the fruits of my labor.

If there are any other alien races you want me to add males to, let me know and I might devote some time to creating those assets and patches as well.</description>
